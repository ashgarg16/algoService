**Crafting the system**

I’m thinking through a trading system with clear boundaries and concise guidelines, aiming for detailed yet concise clarity. Preferences between FastAPI and Flask will be explored at the end.
### Overview and guiding principles

You’re building a small, resilient trading platform: simple to start, modular to evolve, and honest about real-world glitches. We’ll design clear boundaries (web, core, adapters, data), make failure first-class (retries, idempotency, audit), and keep the POC deployable on a single EC2 while paving a clean path to scale.

### System architecture

#### Components and responsibilities

| Component | Responsibility | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Web app (UI + API) | Auth, HTML views, REST/JSON endpoints | Server-rendered HTML to keep complexity low, progressive JS if needed |
| Core services | User, Algorithm, Backtest, Execution, MarketData, Reporting | Pure Python domain logic, fully testable |
| Broker adapters | Unified interface for order/market-data; per-broker implementations | Retries, throttling, error normalization |
| Task runner | Background jobs (backtests, order handling, polling) | Starts simple; upgradeable to a queue |
| Relational DB | Configs, users, strategies, runs, orders, fills, candles/ticks | Postgres recommended; SQLite for dev |
| Cache/message bus (optional) | Volatile state, pub/sub for events | Redis when you add queues/websockets |
| Reverse proxy | TLS termination, static files, routing | Nginx in front of app |

#### Recommended tech stack (POC-friendly)

- **Framework:** FastAPI (async, Pydantic models, auto-docs) with Jinja2 templates for HTML
- **ORM & migrations:** SQLAlchemy 2.x + Alembic
- **Auth:** Server-side sessions (secure cookies), Argon2 password hashing, optional TOTP 2FA
- **Tasks:** APScheduler for timed/background jobs now; plan for Celery + Redis later
- **DB:** PostgreSQL 15+ (RDS if budget allows; else on EC2 with daily backups)
- **Runtime:** Uvicorn workers behind Gunicorn; Nginx reverse proxy; systemd or Docker Compose
- **Observability:** Structured JSON logging, request IDs, Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint
- **Testing & quality:** Pytest, FactoryBoy, Hypothesis (for strategy invariants), Black, Ruff, MyPy, pre-commit

### Data model (initial)

- **User**
  - id, email, password_hash, totp_secret (nullable), role, created_at, last_login_at
- **BrokerAccount**
  - id, user_id, broker_type, api_key_ref, api_secret_ref, access_token_ref, status, last_connected_at
- **Algorithm**
  - id, user_id, name, version, params_json, status, created_at, updated_at
- **BacktestRun**
  - id, user_id, algorithm_id, data_source, date_range, params_snapshot, status, started_at, finished_at, metrics_json
- **ExecutionSession**
  - id, user_id, algorithm_id, broker_account_id, mode, status, started_at, stopped_at, pnl, notes
- **Order**
  - id, session_id, broker_order_id, symbol, side, qty, order_type, price, status, ts, raw_json
- **Fill**
  - id, order_id, qty, price, ts, raw_json
- **Position**
  - id, session_id, symbol, qty, avg_price, realized_pnl, unrealized_pnl, updated_at
- **MarketCandle**
  - id, symbol, timeframe, ts, open, high, low, close, volume
- **MarketTick** (optional initially)
  - id, symbol, ts, bid, ask, last, volume

Design notes:
- **Secrets:** store only references in DB; keep actual secrets in environment or AWS Secrets Manager.
- **Audit:** add audit_log table (entity, entity_id, action, actor_id, ts, before, after).
- **Indexes:** time-series on (symbol, timeframe, ts), and foreign key indexes for sessions/orders/fills.

### Core flows

#### Authentication and authorization

- **Login (session-based):** email + password (Argon2), issue secure cookie, SameSite=Lax, HttpOnly, Secure.
- **2FA (optional):** TOTP enrollment and verification.
- **RBAC:** roles: admin, user; per-user data scoping on every query.
- **CSRF:** for POST/PUT/DELETE form submissions via server-rendered pages.

#### Algorithm configuration

- **Create/edit:** name, version, params (validated via Pydantic schemas).
- **Param registry:** per-strategy schema to enforce types and ranges; store snapshot on run/exec for reproducibility.
- **Versioning:** soft versioning on edit; keep immutable snapshots tied to runs/sessions.

#### Backtesting

- **Modules:** DataLoader (candles), EventLoop, StrategyAdapter, BrokerSim, RiskManager, Metrics.
- **Inputs:** symbol(s), timeframe, date range, params snapshot.
- **Outputs:** equity curve, drawdown, win rate, PF, Sharpe, trade list; persisted to BacktestRun and related tables.
- **Resource control:** chunked data loading, deterministic seeds, timeouts on long runs.
- **Concurrency:** run in background worker; cap concurrent runs to protect CPU/RAM.

#### Live execution

- **Orchestrator:** ExecutionService creates a session, validates broker connection, loads strategy, starts worker.
- **Order pipeline:** StrategySignal -> Risk/Throttler -> OrderManager -> BrokerAdapter -> Confirmation/Fill -> Position/PnL.
- **Resilience:** retries with jitter, idempotency keys per order, circuit breaker per broker, clock drift guard.
- **Controls:** start/stop/pause session; position square-off on stop; kill switch per user.
- **Rate limits:** broker-specific throttling (token bucket); backpressure to strategy if exceeded.
- **Health:** heartbeats per session; stale-heartbeat alert -> auto-pauses if needed.

#### Broker integration

- **Interface:** BrokerClient: connect(), get_account(), stream_quotes(symbols), place_order(), cancel_order(), positions(), orders().
- **Adapters:** one file per broker; normalize errors to typed exceptions; map enums; ensure timezones are explicit (IST/UTC).
- **Tokens:** short-lived token refresh with leeway; proactive renewal tasks.

### Deployment on AWS EC2

#### Infrastructure (POC)

- **EC2:** t3.small or t3.medium, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, EBS 50–100 GB gp3.
- **Networking:** Security Group allowing 80/443 inbound; SSH from your IP only; outbound open.
- **DNS/TLS:** Route53 A record to EC2; Let’s Encrypt via certbot; auto-renew cron/systemd timer.
- **Database:**
  - Start: Postgres on EC2 (docker or system package), daily snapshots to S3.
  - Next: migrate to RDS (db.t3.micro) with automated backups and parameter groups.
- **Secrets:** environment via systemd drop-ins or Docker secrets; consider AWS Secrets Manager for tokens/keys.
- **File storage:** local for logs; avoid user-uploaded files initially. Plan S3 later for exports.

#### Runtime topology

- **Nginx:** TLS termination, proxy to Gunicorn (Uvicorn workers), serve static assets with caching.
- **App service:** 2–4 Uvicorn workers, max-requests with jitter to avoid memory leaks.
- **Worker service:** separate process for backtests and live sessions; shared codebase, independent lifecycle.
- **Scheduler:** APScheduler in worker for token refresh, cleanup, heartbeats, backups.
- **Process management:** systemd units or Docker Compose with restart=always and healthchecks.

#### CI/CD and ops

- **CI:** GitHub Actions: lint/type-check/tests; build artifact or Docker image.
- **CD:** SSH-based deploy or GitHub Actions to pull and restart services; run Alembic migrations on deploy.
- **Backups:** nightly pg_dump to S3 with lifecycle rules; test restore monthly.
- **Monitoring:** 
  - App health: /healthz, /readyz.
  - Logs: structured JSON to file; ship via CloudWatch Agent or vector/Fluent Bit.
  - Metrics: requests/sec, p95 latency, error rate, queue depth, backtest durations, session heartbeats.
  - Alerts: email/Slack on error spikes, failed logins, CPU/RAM, disk 80%.

### Security and data protection

- **Passwords:** Argon2id with strong params; lockout/backoff after failed attempts; password reset flow via signed tokens.
- **Transport:** force HTTPS; HSTS; redirect HTTP->HTTPS; set Secure cookies.
- **Input validation:** Pydantic on all APIs; server-side checks for ranges/whitelists (symbols, timeframes).
- **Least privilege:** DB user with limited rights; separate app vs. migration user.
- **Multi-tenancy:** user_id scoping on every query; query helpers enforce filters; integration tests for leakage.
- **Audit:** capture config changes, logins, session lifecycle, order actions with actor and IP.
- **Compliance hygiene:** time-synced servers (chrony), explicit timezones, immutable logs retained 30–90 days.

### What I need from you to tailor further

- **Broker priority:** which broker(s) first for adapters?
- **Data granularity:** ticks vs. 1m candles for POC?
- **Budget/ops preference:** RDS now or Postgres on EC2 initially?
- **Auth model:** invite-only admin-created users or open signup with email verification?

If you share those, I’ll turn this into concrete tasks with estimates, a minimal ERD diagram, and initial configs (Nginx, systemd/Docker) ready to drop into your repo.
