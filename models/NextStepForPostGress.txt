You can now:
- Use Base.metadata.create_all(engine) to create all tables in PostgreSQL
- Build CRUD operations using SQLAlchemy sessions
- Extend with FastAPI or Flask for RESTful access
- Add authentication, analytics, or dashboards on top
If you'd like, I can generate a full set of CRUD functions for each table or help you scaffold a REST API layer. Ready to take this live
